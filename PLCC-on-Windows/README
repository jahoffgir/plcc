You should be able to get PLCC working on Windows by setting up the
attached plccmk.bat script as a batchfile.  (For security purposes
I changed the file extension to .txt -- you will need to change its
extension to .bat before you proceed).

Here are the steps to get it working:

 0. Create a PLCC folder on your Windows system, e.g., C:\Program Files\plcc.
 1. Copy the plcc.py file and Std directory from ~tvf/CSCI344/PLCC
    to the PLCC folder you created in Step 0.
 2. Add the plccmk.bat file (attached, see above) to the PLCC folder.
 3. Add the path of the PLCC folder to the PATH environment variable.
 4. Modify the return value on line 50 in plcc.py to be the absolute path
    of the PLCC folder.
 5. Before running the batch file, set the LIBPLCC environment variable to
    the PLCC folder name. (Alternatively, modify the plccmk.bat script to
    set the LIBPLCC variable to the PLCC folder name.)

You should then be able to use the plccmk command in a command prompt
session the same as on linux. You will also need javac and python to
be in your PATH environment variable, should it not have been set by
their installers.

Note that the attached batchfile was not completely tested. I do know that
"plccmk -c" and "plccmk" work. Hope this helps.
